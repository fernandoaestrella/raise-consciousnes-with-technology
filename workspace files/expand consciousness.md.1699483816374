- [[combine neuroscience with expansion of consciousness]]
- [[expand consciousness by playing games]]
- [[create visuals that illustrate concepts related to expanding consciousness]]
- everything people do is an attempt to increase their consciousness. It’s just that some methods are more effective. Improving in sports, listening to music, going to church or to the bar, even eating while being distracted, are all an attempt to be more conscious. Spiritual practices more directly addressed this but now some assumptions might appear in people's minds when considering whether to try spiritual practices, so they need to break those assumptions or find ways to do whatever they are doing, more consciously.
	solution:
	1. list out those assumptions in order from most to least prevalent, and with relative incidence of each
	2. provide tools to help them break them
	or
	1. list out activities most people do from most to least common, and by how common each is
	2. provide a path on each of those activities to be more conscious

Consciousness is awareness of something. When you are aware of the specific efforts you are doing and also of the effort you could be doing to achieve the same goal, you immediately notice the difference between the two and probably automatically go for the one with less effort. For example, when laying in any position you may not be aware of having some muscle unnecessarily contracted. When you create in your mind the possibility of laying in the same place without contracting that muscle, you immediately notice the difference and quickly switch to not contracting it. Technology that scans and notifies of this in order to make you aware faster could jump start humanity’s journey towards consciousness

Humor is the capacity to see how two seemingly unrelated things have something in common. When being relaxed and in “yoga” (union with everything else), it is easy to be humorous, that is, it is easy to see that situations that seem to be serious actually have a way to relate to situations that are not serious.
