reasons why i would want to use this tool, in order of priority, from highest to lowest
	1. to not forget what i want to do
	2. to support my effort to achieve what i want to do and becoming how i want to become by coming back to the same document in a disciplined manner
	3. to provide a structured manner to input the many different aspects of myself and the ways i operate into an actionable tool
	4. to do what i want to do with the priority i want to (so, to decide on the priority of each item while seeing the bigger picture)
	5. to present it to the world so we all use a tool to support each other in what we want
	6. to be exhaustive/integral in what i want to do but still be aware of priorities and limitations
	7. to help plan my use of time so what i want gets accomplished how i want it to, when i want it to
	8. to keep goals i may wish to achieve later recorded but inactive, by commenting them out
	9. to eventually learn my goals so i don't need to review them directly in this doc so often
	10. to share this structure with others so that the method, structure, and content may serve as a bootstrap for them
	11. to allow me to see which aspects am i not caring enough for

intention for how to use this doc
	- i would manage two lists 
		- how i want to be
			1. [ ] prep
				1. [ ] slice myself in terms of sets of dimensions. dimensions are not exclusive to each other. Only go the next set of dimensions after having mastered the current set
					1. [ ] [become an individual](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/the-self) (not affected by the environment)
					2. [ ] [yinyang](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK6rWaUiuV4), [male and female](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/elements-male-female), [duality](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/9789548-only-for-a-person-who-is-living-with-duality-there) and [beyond](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/dhyanalinga-going-beyond-duality)
					3. [ ] [the 3 gunas](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/what-is-navratri-nine-days-of-navratri-explained), [the 3 nadis](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/article/the-three-fundamental-nadis)  
					4. [ ] the 4 parts of my existence (body, mind, emotion, energy), [the 4 parts of the mind](https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en/wisdom/audio/four-parts-of-mind)

					%%7. [ ] the 112 ways to attain enlightenment%%
				2. [ ] define how i wish to be in each dimension
			2. execute
				1. every morning
					1. read this list and visualize myself being this way
				2. every night
					1. review how close I came to being how I want to in a quantifiable manner, however subjective
						1. in terms of my intensity
						2. in the set of dimensions i'm currently working on
				3. when my intuition guides me to and on the end (last day or days) of every other [natural world unit of time][^1] measurement, in my computer 
					1. if this is the first time, create a baseline after having made a [natural world unit of time]'s'[^1] worth of sub measurements e.g. a whole month of daily measurements or a whole day of 40 min units of measurement
					2. review overall quantified status and progress
					3. adjust the set of dimensions to focus on
						- if the quantified status is notably lower than the last baseline, go to the previous set of dimensions. if you are on the lowest one, stay there
						- if the quantified status is nearby the last baseline, stay there
						- if the quantified status is notably above the last baseline, increase to the next set of dimensions
					1. adjust the baseline to be the last current baseline
		- what i want to achieve
			1. [ ] prep
				1. [ ] create the categories i want to focus on. make them be exclusive of each other. ensure the list is exhaustive
				2. [ ] expand naturally. if an idea for a depth first advance comes up, write it immediately. keep a little balance with width, too. go on until i can't seem to expand anymore
				3. [ ] edit. compare each goal, look at the bigger picture, and assign an appropriate priority. only the goals i plan to achieve should be kept visible. goals i don't plan to achieve yet should be in their proper priority but hidden. 
				4. [ ] place natural world units of time[^1] in google calendar
				5. [ ] place goals' due dates in my google calendar as a single day event
			2. execute
				1. every night:
					1. look back on the day and journal
						1. find reasons to celebrate. celebrate!
						2. find things to improve. commit to improving them the next day.
					2. in my phone, look at the calendar for the next day, go through the list of what i want to achieve and plan the day accordingly
					3. visualize the day happening how i want
					4. go to sleep
				2. in the morning
					1. wake up
					2. visualize the day happening how i want
					3. do my practices
					4. go on
				3. in the middle of my waking hours, ideally during solar noon, check (if needed, on my phone) how am i doing regarding achieving the goals for the day, including improving what i journaled that i want to improve, and make corrections as needed
				4. on the end (last day or days) of every other [natural world unit of time][^1] measurement, in my computer
					1. review overall progress. plan to perform corrections if needed
					2. look at the calendar for the next natural world unit of time 
					3. consider making edits, including adding goals from the backlog if the current ones are being handled fine or changing a goal's priority or due date

the tool i use should (in order of priority)

my ideas list should
	- contain all the ideas i've though are important
	- be next to how i want to be and what i have decided that i want to do, so it is in context
	- be hierarchized (indicate which ideas solve other problems in the same list)
	- each idea should be tagged with how i feel, emotionally, about it %%([female aspect])%%
	- be grouped into similar topics
	- be prioritized by investigating %%([male aspect])%%
		- what is really the need for this solution, and how does it compare with every other need
		-  if someone else has done it
		- how to connect with them
		- how to use what they've done
		- what tools are available to leverage
	- the ideas with the highest priorities, that are the most common root of many other problems, and which I feel excited about should be added to my to do list when i have the bandwidth to work upon it
	- have 2 sections
		- post and
		- pre processed lists of ideas
	- only contain actionable ideas

how it would be best to share my content so a reader can more directly go where they want to, instead of being distracted with things they don't want
	- there should be a capacity to search
	- content should be hierarchized. there should be an appropriate level of abstraction in the hierarchization so the content tree is neither too wide not too deep
