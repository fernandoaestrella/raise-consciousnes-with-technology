Goal
	To accelerate humanity’s use of electrical technologies to increase their consciousness
	Why
		- Because people already want this, but they have been going about it in an indirect manner
			- Why do we need help when trying to increase consciousness? Because there's too much information and not enough guidance. 
				- There is an internal guidance which we can tap into
				- There is also external guidance which 
					- we may not have been connected to before, or 
					- we may not see how it is beneficial to connect with it just yet (we may be using the intellect and logic too much to determine what to do next), or 
					- the external guidance hasn't adapted itself to us (via technological barriers, language, skill gap, lack of resources), or 
					- we may be too busy, or 
					- we may be too focused on aspects of life which we don't need to (and that we have already solved)
		- Because people already use technologies/tools in order to increase their consciousness (in the form of rituals, practices, substances, sounds, places, spaces, stories, breathing, mindset, etc.), but maybe electrical technologies have not been used as much as they could  
		- Because electrical technologies are extremely widespread in humanity, and tools within them can be spread very rapidly and influentially
		- Because I could not find similar work being done in this area, or the work being done is not prominent enough for what society needs, or it is guided by sources which are not aiming to raise their consciousness concurrently with their effort in this area, or the work is not encompassing enough
	What
	    - Electrical technologies
		    Are all the technologies that use electricity in order to function.
			    - Analog technologies are those that use the various properties of electricity (like voltage, current, resistance, capacitance, inductance and the electromagnetic field) in order to encode information to provide a desired result. They make transmission easy but it is harder to reliably output the exact same information. For example, in a speaker, a signal’s voltage represents the pitch of a sound to be performed at a given instant. This allows the information to be transmitted from where it is stored to the speaker via a cable so the sound is output as desired. If something changes the voltage in the cable, like some movement or some other device operating nearby, the sound output will be different than what was intended. 
			      Common analog technologies include photocopiers, land-line telephones, audio tapes, old CRT televisions (intensity and color information per scan line), and VCRs
			    - Digital technologies are those that use only two possible states of an electrical signal in order to encode information. This makes it easier to output the exact information needed, but storing is a bit harder because now every single data requires more digits in order to be stored. For example, if you want to represent the number 21 (twenty-one) in a numbering system that uses 10 values per digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9), you only need 2 places (21), but if you use one that only has 2 values per digit (0 or 1), now you need at least 5 places (10101).
			      Common digital technologies include most technology controlled by a computer, like: Video Games, Website, Online Buying and Selling, Smartphones, Blockchain Technology, Cryptocurrency, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing, 5G Data, Voice Interfaces or Chat-bots, Video Streaming, eBooks, Digital Music, Geo-location, Blogs, Social Media, Gadgets, 3D Printing, Self-Scan Equipment, ATM Machines, Digital Cameras, Cars and Other Vehicles, Digital Clocks, Robotics, Drones and Missiles, Banking and Finances, Smart Household Appliances 
			Like with any other technology, we don’t say that one is good and the other is bad. We understand them properly and use each where they are best suited. 
		- Consciousness
			Language is probably not a tool fit to describe it properly. The cultures and people that have observed it more carefully describe the whole universe as consciousness. Some people simplify it as saying that it is the capacity of noticing one’s existence.
		- Expand consciousness
			Language is probably not a tool fit to describe it properly. The closest I can describe it with words is by saying that the level of consciousness in a person is the intensity with which it is aware of itself, and everything it is experiencing.
			Consciousness can be expanded though the body, mind, emotions, or energy.
				For example, in terms of the body, an increase in consciousness can be seen as the difference between doing a given physical action with a certain muscle contracted while not being aware of it, and doing the same action with the same muscle relaxed because one was aware of it and therefore was able to relax it.
				It is less important to focus on what the goal looks like than it is to focus on what are the compulsions you want to be freed from, and work on them.
	When
		ASAP
	Where
		Anywhere in the universe where electricity can be manipulated
	Who
		Every human being who is or could be influenced by electrical technologies %%Initially. This scope could be widened in the future e.g. to animals, other sentient beings%%
	How
		- By being aware that logical though has to be balanced with devotion to life (which can find expression though emotional response to situations one lives)
		- By only providing what each person is ready for
		- By continuing our own practices
		- By focusing on the body, mind, emotions, and energy 
		- By considering electrical technologies as a whole
		- By producing the 
			- content (visual, auditory, written),
			- standards,
			- assets,
			- discussions,
			- communities,
			- education,
			- experiences,
			- building blocks,
			- and products
			needed to establish, promote, and experience this goal
		- By preferring one to one interactions when aiming to have people have deeply honest discussions
			Interactions with 3 or more people tend to invite people to unconsciously place more energy in using one of their personalities, as they unconsciously think that everything they do or say, no matter who it is directed to, will be judged by the third person. Personalities are all created in order to survive, but they don't really represent who we truly are and what we really want, deep down. Talking 1-to-1 facilitates relaxing this behavior
		- By doing actions in this order:
			1. Writing ideas
			2. Creating mockups
			3. Suggesting changes to already existing platforms by writing to them
			4. Creating reusable building blocks that facilitate applying these ideas
			5. Creating products that exemplify these ideas
		- By considering what electrical technologies are

								Statistics:
									According to Statista, in 2023, the current number of smartphone users in the world today is 6.92 billion, meaning 86.11% of the world’s population owns a smartphone. This figure is up considerably from 2016, when only 3.668 billion users were 49.40% of that year’s global population. (Source: https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world)
									In 2023, including both smart and feature phones, the current number of mobile phone users is 7.33 billion, which makes 91.21% of people in the world cell phone owners. Feature phones are basic cell phones without apps and complex OS systems, which are more prominent in developing countries. (Source: https://www.bankmycell.com/blog/how-many-phones-are-in-the-world)
									81.6% of Americans, totaling 270 million people, own a smartphone as of 2023. The average American spends 5 hours and 24 minutes on their mobile device each day. Americans check their phones on average 96 times per day, or once every ten minutes.59.16% of website traffic comes from mobile devices, as of 2022. (https://www.zippia.com/advice/smartphone-usage-statistics/)	
								Pros:
									- Ubiquity
									- Development resources are quite streamlined by now
									- Portability
									- Smarts
									- Sensors
									- Integration with other devices
									- Connection
								Cons:
									- Modern phone's battery capacity is very limited, or require knowledge and awareness to manage battery availability. Most are designed to be charged overnight daily.
									- Too many options and too little guidance
									- Used at times it would be best not to (eating, being in nature)
									- Sensitive to crashes and water
									- Others push their values into oneself (knowingly or otherwise)
									- Not accessible to certain populations
								Ideas:
									- Before "being allowed to use a tool" (like a smartphone), the tool can suggest the user to have reverence towards it
										If we don't become aware/respectful towards the ways in which a tool enhances us, we may not value it appropriately
										- adding some delay before using it for the first time in the day
										- adding some extra delay after memorable dates (like the date of the birth of the character, which may be the same first day the device was first used)
										- It can be done playfully, like 
											- with a character to which users have to request permission to use the phone
											- doing what it may like (these behaviors may be preferred by specific characters and not others) (the selection of the character may reflect which aspects we want to focus on) (the character may behave in a certain manner if exposed to situations it doesn't like, gently guiding users to change their behavior) (still, all behaviors are aimed at reminding users of what they want. it should not feel like the character is pushing the user in a way the user has not intended to go. some users may not yet feel they need to consider certain changes, like less noise, but they should be guided to considering it if and when something or someone eventually detects it may be useful)
												- cleaning it before use
												- spinning it (which resets magnetic sensors)
												- uncluttering it
												- not exposing it to noise, both from outside and from inside the device
												- not dropping it
												- charging it
												- charging it at certain hours of the day
												- putting it in Low Battery Mode if not being used for long periods of time
												- doing a gesture, like joining hands or smiling. the character can react to the gesture or lack of it
									- Apps can help people track how they feel and what they do
										- By constantly/repeatedly becoming aware that one is not feeling as desired, this can motivate a person to decide to do something for their wellbeing. But it may not, so we can go for the next step
									- Based on knowing how the user feels, apps can encourage users to decide what they want that situation to become
										- If an information makes a user feel tired, and the user has just recorded that in the app, the app can ask what variable may change in that situation that would make it feel energizing. In very rare and careful manners maybe apps can suggest potential solutions, but mainly the user should be encouraged to be the one defining his own desires.
									- helps you find why you actually want to do what you think you want to do. Helps you dig deeper
									- Helps you trust that you can achieve what you want when you are feeling like buying something
									- Helps you be aware that every time you connect with someone (e.g. directly talking to someone, or posting something anyone can see, or anytime you use the Share button that takes you to an OS-managed menu), you may consider that you are taking something from them (like time, energy, attention), so it could guide you to reflect and ensure you are doing it in everyone's best interest.

								According to a report by Statista, in 2019, almost half of private households worldwide were estimated to have a computer at home
							3. video games consoles
								Definition of game 
									A game is a situation in which rules are placed so that actions need to be taken in a certain way to achieve an objective. You may know common “games” but consider that any single action can be done playfully. You can make walking into a game. In fact, many kids play the game of avoiding lines in the pavement, without being taught such a game. They are naturally playful. While playing, the execution of actions keeps getting refined over and over until the objective is attained. This refinement is achieved by noticing the goal, acting to achieve it, receiving feedback about whether the goal was achieved, and trying again. If players align their body, mind, emotions and energy to be in a state that is conducive to increase their consciousness, this loop leaves them fundamentally transformed, and when they try again, they are in a different state than they were at the beginning of the previous loop. This transformation happens via the energy received with the feedback. The feedback can be something very directly linked to the game like pieces or messages, but it can be from anything, as the definition of game we have used does not constrain what is part of the game. The feedback could be whether your breathing was as desired after a series of actions, or whether you feel loving towards something. As you get closer to the objective you’ve chosen, you get a subtle reward in your system, which lights you up to understand yourself better to then align even more with how reality is. The objective chosen should be reachable with the consciousness available, otherwise it will be too hard to achieve and therefore transformation will not be reached. The objective chosen should be attainable with the upper edge of what consciousness is available, otherwise it will be too easy and, if achieved, it would have gone over alignment that is already properly established, which would provide very little transformation. Operating in the upper edge of available consciousness is what psychologists call being in a flow state. All parts of the process of interacting with games can be designed to be done more consciously: designing, choosing, playing, life "beyond" games. They could be considered separately but a common base from which to derive the designs should be considered to make the process more scalable.
								Designing games
									How can the task of designing games be designed in a way that increases consciousness?
										It’s been said that creating videogames is one of the hardest tasks that exists. Several factors can be attributed to it, like the fact that many skills are needed, how consumer demand pushes the art, and the complexity of the technical task			
											- A video game requires many different skills and knowledge. Game design, music composition, animation, storytelling, specialized knowledge (depending on the topic), computer programming, marketing, community building. 
											- Consumer demand seems to push creators to create massive projects to remain competitive 
											- More broadly, video games can be considered simulations of a reality. As the simulation becomes more complex, better programming practices are required to keep the projects maintainable and scalable, which may not be available in people who were focusing too much on the monetary compensation of technology related job opportunities instead of the enjoyment that thinking clearly brings 
										Therefore, to design games more consciously, the view that only certain people can have certain skills has to be reduced, 
											- Every person should
												- see how to connect to their capacity to be playful, as they were naturally playful and exuberant in their youth, 
												- Notice that adding rules can make activities more enjoyable, and not necessarily less approachable, 
												- Feel capable of connecting to music and to somehow express themselves musically, as vibration and rhythm is an inherent part of all creation 
												- Notice that being aware of minute details in their movement makes them more physically capable, therefore they can animate 
												- Recall how enthralled they are by good stories and how good stories are at making us remember important information 
												- See every form of art as a tool to rediscover the amazement that everything in this creation can ignite 
												- Appreciate that seeing every element of a complex situation helps bring clarity to decision making, therefore they can be moved to think like programmers 
											- A better way to be introduced to different tools has to be established.
												At the core, the challenge when using different tools is not having knowledge about how to use them. This knowledge can be a lack of vocabulary and lack of knowledge of hierarchies. The most common way to gain knowledge is to gain experience by doing the required actions in just about any way until the basics are understood and then advanced knowledge can be built on top of it. The risk with this method is the possibility that some advanced concept is introduced before a more basic one was established, which can create confusion and/or loss of time. This can happen when people are too focused on getting a given result as soon as possible. A better way can be to take some time to study the tool in a general sense, starting with the basics, and making sure every concept introduced builds upon knowledge previously known to whoever is learning, and not upon any concept that hasn’t been learned.
											- One should approach the task by starting with the end goal, not by convoluting the process with other steps.
												If the goal is to bring happiness and peace, it must be experienced first and subsequently at every step of the process, instead of hoping that by doing the game one might reach notoriety or financial success, which would, in one’s mind, then lead to happiness.
									Why should the difficulty in designing and building games even be considered?
										Because millions of people have been touched by them in profound ways and therefore may have tried their hand at creating the world they want through them. Therefore, people already want to use games to make a world they feel is better
								Choosing games
									How can the process of choosing games lead to the use of games whose use increases consciousness? How can the process of choosing games be designed to lead to playing in a manner that increases consciousness?
									While any activity can be performed in more or less conscious manners, people might need help that matches the level of their consciousness, the paths that adapt better to how they currently are, or their current state at a given moment. 
									In this regard, the process of selecting a game can be improved: 
										Somehow a system can obtain information from the user to propose a game that adapts best to the input information. It may not just consider the current state, but also the previous state, and the potential future states. It can either ask the information or determine it somehow. A better categorization of games may be needed, one not guided by user tags, but by dimensions all games are evaluated upon. For example, instead of saying a game is an Action RPG and another is a Simulator, they could each have a score for how fast are most actions required while playing them, and how important is the story to the overall enjoyment of the experience, among many others.</Choosing_Games>
									Playing_Games
									How can games be designed so that their use increases consciousness? 
									While any activity can be performed in more or less conscious manners, people might need help that matches the level of their consciousness, the paths that adapt better to how they currently are, or their current state at a given moment. 
									In this regard, a games design can be improved: 
									Regarding the body,  
									The system could detect how many inputs were undesired and feed that information back to the user, in an aggregate manner or as they happen 
									More fine control may be required 
									Breathing can be involved via open or closed loop systems. That is, the game can give hints as to how to breathe at certain moments and/or it could grab the information of how the user is breathing at a given moment. 
									The game can ask for certain body parts to be flexed, and all others to be relaxed. The importance of relaxing all other parts is that a given command from the brain may be intended to contract only specific muscles, but because of undesired patterns, other muscles may be contracted. So, intentionally contracting only what is desired “cleans” the system that issues instructions in the body 
									Regarding the mind, 
									Breathing can be intertwined in the story 
									Players can learn to more fluidly change the role they are playing in the game 
									Players can learn to enjoy roles they may not have enjoyed before. 
									Extra rules can be placed to guide players to discover other dimensions of the same situation 
									Players can be motivated to create their own rules 
									Rules can be intertwined to create other stories on top of the delivered experience 
									(roles/rules are interchangeable in the prev lines) 
									Regarding the emotions, 
									Players can realize the emotion they have towards a certain situation is under their control, and that they can feel in any manner at any situation, by controlling the color tones, music, topics discussed, speed, intensity of a given situation. 
									Regarding the energy, 
									Energy can be guided in a certain way via music, breathing, body contractions, thoughts, preparation of the environment,  
									How can the process of playing games be designed to increase consciousness? 
									How can the rest of life spent while not playing an established game be designed to increase consciousness, taking into consideration the lessons learnt while playing games more consciously? 
									How do different levels of consciousness look like in each part of consciousness? 
									In order, from lowest to highest (the order applies both to the way the parts of consciousness are ordered as well as to the elements in them): 
									Body: not feeling the body, controlling the body, feeling the body, observing how the body acts. 
									Mind: no thoughts, thoughts happen, noticing thoughts, not being ruled by thoughts, observing thoughts. 
									Emotion: no feelings, feeling feelings, controlling feelings, choosing to feel feelings, being devoted, being love 
									Energy:  
									How can each part of consciousness be used to increase it? 
									Body: contracting exactly the muscles you need to and no more, relaxing the muscles you need to relax, noticing when something hurts or feels pleasant, feeling how food feels, feeling how sounds feel, not holding the breathing muscles neither on contraction nor on relaxation,  
									Mind: Seeing clearly, noticing when overthinking, noticing details, 
									Emotion: feeling feelings, being aware of feelings, controlling feelings, choosing to feel feelings, being devoted, being love 
									Energy: feeling how sensations in the body feel, accepting, clearing chakras, </Playing_Games>
								Beyond games
									How can the lessons learned while playing games in a more conscious manner be applied to the rest of life beyond games in a reliable manner?

									- For all
										- Our attention can be modeled to be depleted by each message we process. We could reflect on how much energy each quantum of information (a post, a comment, etc) takes from us, and we could report it in it.
										- Every bit of information makes us feel a certain way. People can report how it makes them feel. We can use that information to show the kind of information that people want to see. People can configure the app to be shown content that will make them feel a certain way. But ultimately, the app should guide them to be able to feel however they want to feel no matter the situation
										- "Open 7 chakras" challenge. 
											Post a pic in which you show how you really are most of the time in any given month/year period (do the math if you need to) and honestly answer in the caption the 7questions that are needed to open the 7 chakras
										- A map of influence needs to be created so that we map out the order in which it would be most ideal to invite people to gain internal wellbeing 
											And then we could go in order through this map, trying to offer tools for wellbeing to these highly influential people first. We should probably not immediately start with the most influential people but try a few mid level ones first in case we make mistakes, so that we learn from the mistakes before going for the most highly influential ones. The tool to create this map of influence should be easily available to people so they could use it to have a sense of how influence is spread in their circles, but it should also be used centrally to more generally map influence in the whole world, so a group of committed people could plan to reach them in the most efficient order
											The variables that could be considered in order to determine what defines someone being influential to someone else:
												- The amount of messages they share amongst themselves
												- Whoever has the most initiative to start or continue a conversation after a certain pause in time may be most influenced by whoever that person is messaging

Afterword
	I’m very open to suggestions and guidance.
	If you have anything to tell me about this project, like if you
		- are interested, 
		- have suggestions, 
		- are working on something similar, 
		- know of someone working on this or something similar, 
	please let me know at fernandoaestrella@gmail.com.
	That being said, currently the goal of this project is to have minimal discussions of aspects that are hard to prove to intellect and logic alone, like whether machines can achieve consciousness, and so on, and rather to make measurable contributions to raising human consciousness. This is where aiming to raise our own consciousness as we go along can guide us.
	Thanks!
