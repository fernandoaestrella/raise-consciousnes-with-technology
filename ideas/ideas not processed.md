- Everyone should be game developers in the sense that they can create games out of anything and can manipulate how they do things so they are more playful and therefore more involved
    
- Crimes can be though of as situations where society hasn’t created the specific game that adapts to that person who made the crime. See the “robber to the stars”
    
- Médium is the message. This fact damages people like Elon musk in ways people are not aware of, when he tweets so much. There are nuances about a message that can be averted by both displaying more of the emitter, perhaps with video, and by the receiver having more unprejudiced attention, and by the receiver being calm. You get a better idea of is the reality of what wants to be transmitted #Proyects
    
- Social media. You post the things you’d like to do or places you’d like to go. Software matches friends that would like to do the same things. You could put a priority to the things you’d like to do, and the results come in your order of priority. Or you could prioritize the friends you’d like to do it with. But make it in a conscious manner so it becomes an opportunity to really see everyone as the same as everyone else and as you, and to be with them without prejudices. You could also be notified when someone indicates they’d like to do the same thing as you. #Proyects
    
- Underlying conversations in different dimensions
    
- Reason why Kings might be venérated maybe Because You servants may understand that kings are equal to them, and so they noticed their limitations, and that they if they were kings would be more drawn to act favorably towards someone if that someone would treat them nicely, and so they treat kings nicely, of course the ideal would be that they treat everyone nicely, no matter white but they are seeing reality clearly.
    
- Moving from a push to a pull model when offering any kind of service is very important. You want to offer the service as close to the instant when the need is detected in your client as possible. You don’t want to spend effort in promoting yourself at moments or to people who won’t use your service. Your waste your and everyone’s resources if you do so
    
- Human cultures evolve just like species do. A similar source energy is available for all cultures in the same way, but the way it is expressed is different in each for various reasons. Probably the other species near that culture play a big role in how it finds expression
    
- There may be a benefit from going up and down the hierarchy of needs, in that order. As you reach some benefit in the transcendence level, you may focus first on bringing that benefit to your relationships by conducting them more consciously, as opposed to going back to the base and conducting your survival more consciously. Anyway, connecting better with more people will facilitate survival. You then conduct your shelter more consciously and easily, and then your survival. And then you go back up in order
    
- The reason why we compose pieces with such a variety of instruments is so that we produce vibrations at the most important points that our physiology benefits from
    
- Body = earth. Mind = water. Emotion = fire. Energy = air.
    
- Mom should increase her femininity
    
- Subtler dimensions and elements are related to femininity
    
- can software be consecrated so that it can be replicated easily and people using it are powerfully benefitted?
    
- how do chakras work? is it that they are like a signal at a given frequency, and balancing them means keeping that signal at a given absolute or relative amplitude (relative to other chakras)? if so, is it useful for most people to have chakra-specific interventions or is a more generalized approach most useful (and maybe the next step in humanity's evolution is to go for the specific intervention)?
    
- In the future, there may be a career for Game Masters: individuals with mastery of the skill of game developing and balancing that would shift game's rules on the fly to make them more interesting, or balanced, or whatever goal may be desired at a given moment.
    
- Everything people do is an attempt to increase their consciousness. It’s just that some methods are more effective. Improving in sports, listening to music, going to church or to the bar, even eating while being distracted, are all an attempt to be more conscious. Spiritual practices more directly addressed this but now some assumptions might appear in peoples minds when considering whether to try spiritual practices, so they need to break those assumptions or find ways to do whatever they are doing, more consciously
    
- When one proposes resource allocation changes, the next question is: where will resources come from? The answer is: they should at least come from the place where in the current model, you would have spent more in solving the issue this solution aims to solve, and the reason for this is because the solution should be addressing a more root cause of the problem, therefore ensuring that there is a higher probability the solution will be solved. In case a mistake in allocation is made, the more frequently resources allocation is re analyzed, the less effect the mistake will have. Therefore, the faster we can log and process measurements of how on track are we to reach a goal, the more frequently we will be able to keep doing resource allocation analysis
    
- Monetary value is no indication of the intrinsic value of something. If one is interested in solving problems that stem from or are connected to economic conditions, one must be aware of this key fact. Money is only a temporary indicator of value that gives a snapshot of how the society at a given point in time valued something. Something else might come that changes the value of everything. If one wants to solve problems, one has to provide sensibility or measurement of the intrinsic value of things to people. One could choose to be involved in something that has no monetary value if one sees clearly how that has a more intrinsic value than the current monetary value attached to it. Society could define something as having a given value and find a way to compare everything else to that. Parallel modes of value transfer could be employed (e.g. a given coin is only usable for vital services while another coin is only usable for less vital aspects). Video games can simulate these cases
    
- People may not support many things because they are not aware of the measurements that have been made in regards to that situation. Without a sense of concrete context they are unable to choose to act because they feel they will not know if they are making progress.
    
- future live stream model (which will get some recognizable name) in which people play games but they act as well as they can as if they were literally living inside the game world, both inside the game world and outside of it (they would take care of as many details as possible, like the speed they would walk,or what they would answer, and maybe would not be talking repeatedly as is common in games. outside of the game they would be aware of the feelings the game wants to convey and they would choose to feel those feelings consciously. they may be immersed in a way that angers them but they will realize they will be able to control themselves)
    
- each musical expression is one out of infinite compositions that could exist. when one listens to a tune or plays it, one is choosing to live in that tune. but infinite options are there. is there a benefit to matching more precisely the message one wants to express/the composition one wants to dive into? when one improvises, perhaps one is coming closer to that intended tune. one should not feel limited to play the song one thought of playing. one should feel free to modify it in small or large amounts. one should feel open to express themselves in song, more frequently. is there a benefit to always being surrounded in the sounds one wants to be in? nowadays, there's the concept of a "soundscape". how can one balance being constantly enveloped in sound and the innate push towards stillness? how can we rank tools/instruments (existing or not) in order of how well they allow us to more easily express the compositions we want to express?
    
- sound may come from a given place in the universe. one can consciously ignore the understanding of where it comes from and focus only on the sound, allowing any other possible world (for example, a world where sound spontaneously bursts forth) to let itself tell us whether they are there or not.
    
- video game recommending engine. input: current state based on several different dimensions, and desired state on the same dimensions, time available. output: schedule of games to reach the desired state. Or simply input the desired state and output gives you what to play based on a library of games tagged in the required dimensions
    
- Open sourced meaning making. Open platform to critically analyze positions or tasks and to process them based on a set of previously defined rules. For example, a user can submit a talk (via a YouTube link), and participants can compare the talk to a list of known logical fallacies, to tag the talk at certain timetables with a proposed logical fallacy and the reason why they think that fallacy applies there (justification)
    
- Attention to detail is the key for my family to become more loving
    
- IoT for the state of the world. Single screen dashboard to show how the world is doing in general, and then you can dig through to see how it is doing by each metric, and then in each metric you can dig through to see what exactly is pulling that metric down.
    
- The key benefit of OEE in industry is that it allows you to see data in an actionable manner. The key problem is that information is saved in a way that is not actionable, and does not present potential actions in order of relevance. The benefit of using dashboards is that we can condense information via some processing, and then we can present the results, so that we know in what area to focus, more quickly. we can present in several levels of depth. The ability to see a very low level of processing of data is not necessarily what would be most effective (an ordered list of potential actions ordered by potential impact might be the most effective but would require the way to measure success to be programmable and flexible) but is useful as a diagnostic step towards determining the proper way to measure success
    
- This will avoid the situation in which people "complain that someone is now supporting a cause when they did not support X cause when it happened". This should make it easy to see everything happening at once, and not depend on news outlets to determine what to focus on at a given moment. I can provide better explanation on request.
    
- Way to save unidentified plants: take all location tagged pictures of plants on the internet, detect all plants in them, pass each plant through species detecting software, if a species is not found, save a reference to the photo, it’s location, and the percentage of certainty that it has not been identified, to a database. Sort by the percentage and review. Potentially someone can go grab the plant, sequence the DNA, save the seeds in the modern Noah’s ark
    
- Physical board game where everything is made of paper and at every turn the players can do an attack on others doing a physical action to attempt to aim at and remove enemy pieces. Trebuchets can be used with rubber bands. The point is that proyectiles should come out of the space designated for a given tile. Everything can be paper based. You can shoot the proyectiles with the hands or with some paper contraption helped by a rubber band. You can make it turn based. At every turn, character moves a certain number of steps. Projectiles can be randomly scattered through the map. Aim can be to make enemy pieces fall down, which can encourage design revisions. Limits can be put to the amount of paper used per character. Every player can have an army. Win condition could be to defeat all. A direct atttack can be by players who are next to each other. They would be moved to a box where a paper sumo match can take place. Winning can be determined by making other player drop, which …
    
- …Encourages research and strategy into different character shapes. Winning could also be by making enemy fall out of the defined arena, or by touching enemy with a paper sword held by the character. Humans should not directly touch paper characters but rather can tap on the box to make them move. Indirect control can be achieved by using an implement that could apply a limited amount of force through a stick by holding the stick horizontally at two points between 2 spun rubber bands, so that if more than the desired force is applied to what is holding the rubber bands, the stick would slide out of them. The human would only grab the structure which is holding the rubber bands, not the stick itself. Game can encourage using recycled paper. Instructions and templates can be made freely available online, and prepared packages can be sold, using recycled papers.
    
- If we can capture the vibrations of a persons energy body, we could convert the signal through a Fourier transform to indicate which frequencies are currently with a higher or lower amplitude than they should, and what to do about it. Not that I know what the proper amplitude should be for each. Maybe it varies
    
- Chakras are energy centers. Each vibrates at a given freq. they go increasing as they are higher in the body. If one of them has too little amplitude, it manifests one way. Making that sound helps increase its amplitude.
    
- Consciousness is awareness of something. When you are aware of the specific efforts you are doing and also of the effort you could be doing to achieve the same goal, you immediately notice the difference between the two and probably automatically go for the one with less effort. For example, when laying in any position you may not be aware of having some muscle unnecessarily contracted. When you create in your mind the possibility of laying in the same place without contracting that muscle, you immediately notice the difference and quickly switch to not contracting it. Technology that scans and notifies of this in order to make you aware faster could jump start humanity’s journey towards consciousness
    
- Tell isha volunteers about maybe creating a parking spot for mobile homes
    
- House built around a tree (tree inside the house) while not disturbing the tree’s growth
    
- Humor is the capacity to see how two seemingly unrelated things have something in common. When being relaxed and in “yoga” (union with everything else), it is easy to be humorous, that is, it is easy to see that situations that seem to be serious actually have a way to relate to situations that are not serious.

- Life saving belt to be worn with swimsuit
    
- Attachment to anything is not divine. Therefore attachment to an outcome is not divine. When we want a specific outcome, we don’t keep open to what else could happen. We must stay open to the fact that we do not know everything about life and the divine. This is the basis of “faith”: that you are calm in the conviction that something else can happen. Whether it is a good or bad thing, depends on other things.
    
- Blog where ideas of spirituality are explained visually
    
- People considered as psychotic may simply be solving problems with some metaphor. By itself that might not be a problem but it becomes a problem when they take too little variables into account and then try to live in society with the rest of life.
    
- It might be that the reason people have to cheat is because they aim for a relationship where a human goal that is too low is solved, so when it is solved they tend to solve a higher one outside of it
    
- The purpose of talking with someone should not be to feel ok they are talking to you. There should be a purpose more aligned with life, like improving each other (infinite possibilities there)
    
- Time’s purpose is for it to be the tool through which you learn
    
- To solve a problem you could think of a metaphor and try to solve the metaphor. Then try to apply the metaphoric solution to the original problem. This feels like how witchcraft solves problems. For example: the idea that one will be fulfilled by being with someone very attractive could feel like it is very strongly stuck to oneself, like a rat trap. The problem is that if one tried to pull a very hard glue from oneself, one might rip the structure of what one is. Which might work, and the next step after it could take a lot of energy (to build oneself back up). But another solution is to use heat. More precisely, a flame. A flame purifies. It removes the sticky surface without destroying your skin. What is fire as a solution for the original problem? Hot showers? Looking at fire? Burning with love and passion? Taking sun? Having passionate intercourse?
    
- If an undesired and repeated thought has a certain electrical signal in the brain, maybe stimulating with the inverse signal will make the connections to that idea be weaker. Or detecting when you are about to think it can help a computer tell you you Are about to think it And stop you on your tracks. Of course this is just a kickstarter for improvement. The best possibility is that you have ideas, a mental state or a spiritual level that don’t let you reach this point
    
- ghost data for running
    
- perhaps being "meditative" can just be described as being in a low energy state because it is the most stable, similarly to how atoms become stable in certain ways because that's how the laws work
    
- Game idea: a group of players try to gain points. They loop around assigning a drawer for each turn. Each turn, the drawer gets a somewhat random scribble. He has to decide what he plans to draw over the scribble to make the scribble resemble something else. He writes what he decides to draw and starts drawing it. Other players see him drawing and try to guess. The faster a user guesses, the more points it gets. The drawer would repeat the same process with the same scribble two more times. He would start wth the same scribble but try to resemble different objects.
    
- THe fact I mght want to get a relationship further deep might be dishonest because i know in my soul that that level of deepness is related to deeper levels of connection and therefore not what i should do
    
- saying "yeah im fine but I dont have X" is the same as saying "i want to be in a good state. i dont have X. i would be good if i had X". the fallacy comes from noticing that there will always be a different X, therefore I will always be in that thought pattern. solution is to be ok with this way.
    
- the though that there will be a loss when people leave is misleading because 1) see previous point 2) i could always come back 3) only 1/4 leave 4)there are always people everywhere
    
- Is it possible to “train spiritual muscles” through video games?
    
- in the past, people had deep insights about the nature of reality because they were more in tune with nature and less identified with ideas
    
- Since very young, I have like food to be so hot that I can barely eat it. I never though about why, but now I think it was my soul trying to tell me to eat it that way so that it is easier to digest.
    
- Since very young I have liked to draw mazes, not labyrinths, and didnt know why. It is because labirithns are an archetypal pattern found in the universe.
    
- Which needs are more stressful to fulfill? (Thinking in terms of maslows hierarchy)
    
- People evaluate whether to pursue an relationship with another by adding up points in each of these categories: physical attractiveness, willingness of the other to connect, capacity of the other to supply needs, social status change, willingness of the other to support me, intellectual stimulation, capacity of oneself to bring out support from the other.

- By focusing on having more changes of speaker per unit of time one might ensure maximum engagement in the topic from all parts
    
- In order to make events welcoming someone should be attentive of who is coming in, welcome them and introduce them to someone.
    
- In the same way one shows love to the self by taking care of the body and the mind, consciously cleaning one’s surroundings is a practice of self care that serves to show oneself self care.
    
- Car with removable separation so that you could car pool with strangers.
    
- If you have a certain response to something, like not wanting to approach dirty people on the streets, many reasons might be feeding in to generate this output. Physically it happens that a number of connections to this output generate it. Technically there is amount of physical connections for each reason, a strength of connection and a speed at which they trigger. By analyzing these one could determine the relative strength of each reason, and finally answer whether one is doing it mostly because of fear, rejection, etc
    
- why do we like symmetry? asymmetry indicates it is harder for a person to face the challenges of life. for ex, if a person lacks an arm. other more subtle assimetries are unconsciously considered as well, like facial asimmetry, or others. they are considered because they are an extension of the more noticeably assimmetries. of course, a more careful analysis would conclude that there are reasons to keep those with assimmetries around, because life is complex and those assimmetric people might help us in other ways.
    
- A transport system that knew everything about everyone on it and then showed the ways they matched and people could decide to find the people they matched with. For example: is this bus there are these many Italians, Serbians, etc. These many people graduated from this high school, these many people love xyz, etc
    
- Get paid for looking at other commuter’s eyes. (Must be done with care, might be emotional)
    
- Promoting excuses for people to connect everywhere
    
- Looking in the eyes for an extended time. Rock balancing. Unstructured play. Social non verbal and verbal cues giving and taking from a healthy position. Caressing the self ( noticing where negative thoughts appear) and others. Time scheduling and following it. Practicing all of those skills alone but also exploiting the fact that there are other people with you. Noticing the most specific good you can on others/thing others need/ ways to help them/ topic they might like. Dance. Creatively writing your own life.
    
- Plan to radically change people’s brain patterns: takes 21 days, has a bunch of trainings, some sort of drug/s that put you in a place of reset, and healthy sexual exploration. May need to be taken a few times in life to return back to it. Everything that you learn you keep practicing it the next days. Starts with breathing training. Then healthy eating (selection, cooking and eating (mindfully)). Then healthy rest. Then mindfulness of everything. Then movement/exercise. Then cleanliness. exploration of pleasure in a very general sense and being in touch with feelings. Then social skills. Support network creation. Showing oneself healthily. Deprogramming mind. Accepting flaws of self and others. Creativity. goal setting from the infinite potential available to us, not feeling overwhelmed or like we have to comply with a certain personality. Ego death. Noticing how the mind almos unconsciously veers us into an uncreative path.
    
- Learning to look for the right people. Learning to love all, even those we don’t look for. Goal setting. Habit making. Sexual understanding. telling the truth. Cold exposure. Un attachment. Other specific skills for the outer world.
    
- trepanation: boring a hole in the skull to treat some things. electric eels, burning the head, warm and sweet bath and trepaning were some of the treatments to headaches. triggers of headaches: changes in sleep, eating, stress, lights, noise, specific foods, tension in body,over triggering of normally functioning signals, physical exertion, too little physical activity, medication, posture, hormones, jaw clenching, straining neck or shoulder muscles. therefore, learning about massages has great potential. conversely, some changes/challenges are needed. ideally they would be done slowly. there are no pain receptors in the brain but there are in a certain layer of it (the pia matter) under a hard layer and a suspending layer, so it might be hard for pressure to reach the nerves and veins.
    
- How are headaches formed, how to solve them, what are the most common, how do they fit with my knowledge of neuroscience, how did people solve them in the past
    
- How to most effectively carry out conversations while keeping both parties interested and why is it important
    
- Why should we care to treat the different steps of a though process differently? Roughly: conditions that make a certain though possible > thinking it > evaluating it > concluding > planning > starting > execu Why the question? Because the law asks one to not do only the last step of a thought process (carrying out the act) while Jesus Christ asks not to do previous steps of the process (not to think them) therefore one could imagine that a more perfect society might go back in the process and catch bad thoughts early. Although a caveat must be considered, and it is that a mind is able to think any thought, which does not mean that the person might do them, but might indicate that they need help, and therefore if a person thinks a bad thing, a decision should not be very drastic. Also, the conditions that took that person to think that should be analyzed to see how they could be improved, if deemed useful. Also, it is useful to be able to think many kinds of thoughts, “good” or “bad”
    
- Stress actually reduces neurogenesis. Bdnf ngf
    
- Difference between feeling and expressing emotions.
    
- Rank of emotions (some are more primitive than others)
    
- Cortisol facilitates expenditure of energy. It’s related to being in a stressful states. Maybe it keeps skinny people skinny.
    
- You can be fine wherever you are. Maybe you can be fine in monogamy or in poliamory. There are reasons to be in either. The guide to decide which to follow would be to be honest with how you feel and to become psychologically healthy and communicative. Bare all your shame. If you do monogamy as an act or love (recognizing that you feel impulses to be with other people but choose to be with this one person) that is more healthy than just assuming that you shouldn’t feel impulses. If you decide your brain to be wired for poliamory and you find yourself unable to change that (although there are people that say that one can control the body through the mind) maybe you can talk about it deeply
    
- When people in a relationship do not get what they need to feel safe in a relationship, they either get it in the safest way they know or they repress it. Repression creates illness in which the person becomes the center of attention because they are about to die, such that their need is met. There are 2 ways to solve it. Get the need met in a healthy way or realize that needs don’t in reality need to be supplied. You can be well. The needs come from imprints of what you think your needs are based on what your parents unconsciously imprinted in you.
    
- People want novelty because it brings them to the present moment, and that’s where magic happens
    
- In a fearless society people would just massage each other in public transport if they feel like it
    
- How to define creativity in terms on neuroscience?
    
- The fact that people are unhealthy comes from people’s dna activating a certain pattern in their brain calling them to do things that will be better for them (for example, feeling sorrow for missing someone, which is good and natural and is a call to accept that connection is good), and then something else, maybe their emotions, activating a contrary pattern (like fear of being alone, which would move someone to go out and try to hook up), and so being in this differential state creates the conflict that they need to solve. The solution is obviously to heed the call that has prevalence, the one from the dna. This applies to everything like the call to decide how to exercise, to eat, to do, to think, to fuck
    
- First step to help people improve is to have them listen to themselves to notice if they have something that bothers them. In order to listen they must be calm enough to think. To go into that state they need a reason. The reason is “because something is hurting you!”. After that, either critical thinking, helping people notice that the calculation is hard but that they can do it and that it doesn’t matter if they fail, or emotion desensitization, in some order and with some weight, would be good.
    
- A shaman asks 5 questions to pinpoint where you went off: when did you stop singing, when did you stop dancing, when did you stop enjoying stories, when did you stop enjoying being alone with yourself, when did you lose awe for life?
    
- Same as there is a negative vicious cycle in trusting others, there’s a positive one. You try to destroy shame by accepting things about yourself and others, you notice that the calculation (of balancing the good and the bad) is hard but you determine that you are capable of doing the calculation, because you have a brain, but even if you fail, it doesn’t matter, because all your mind is looking for is that you do the things you know you have to do to be better, it doesn’t care whether you actually achieve the results, and so you will feel motivated when trying to do the calculation, which will probably end up making a better calculation, destroying more shame, and so on
    
- If people are so scared of their faults, how about they just write them all down and share them. To notice that all people have faults. And to notice others’ have the same faults. Ideally, the ideas would be identified with the persin's name, but an intermediate training step could be to do it anonymously.
    
- what makes a question more interesting than another? when it has more possible valid answers, although only one is the real, honest answer
    
- How do people decide which values to follow? They compare two contrary values in the following manner. They activate both in their brain. Then they look at all the connections each have. Then they choose to keep the one that has more connections of different types, which would mean that it would be more probable that keeping it would be productive in most situations. For example, when deciding whether to be good or bad,
    
- Why do, in order to feel more “connected”, people need to find "common ground"? In a very deep level, you trust no one more than yourself for your own survival. When you find in which areas you are similar to others, you notice how they are like you. And then you trust them because they are like you and you trust yourself.
    
- Why are people open to meet people in some contexts and not in others, if people are basically the same in either context? Which reasons are more easily defeatable? Fear.
    
- Why is pain such a good teacher, when is it such a dangerous method? Stress promotes neurogenesis. It’s proven to happen in exercise.But also probably emotional stress promotes it as well. And other things might as well.Facing our fears. Sleep. Emotional attachment when seeing or listening to something motivating, like church,sports, talk. New neurons and connections form. But the right connections are not strong enough Yet. Those that you want to promote need Conscious training. Like whenever you learned a new skill.
    
-  At first you had to consciously remember what you wanted to do. At first you remembered a long time after when you needed it. But that made the connection stronger. Until eventually you remembered it on time. And eventually you didn’t even have to think about it. If you have an emotional deficiency that you need to improve, the process is the same. Eventually you will remember in time to be calm. Religion or science or whatever can give you the reasons to be calm, and training will actually get you there.
    
- That’s why it is said that things take time to learn. You need time for neurogenesis to happen, connections to form and connections to be strengthened. So if you’re motivated to more consistently do the training needed, you will more quickly reach the peace you desire. (So if for example anything makes you feel bad, anything you did or others did, this knowledge can assure you that there is a proof that you can change your brain. Therefore you are motivated to look for a reason to change and to train on changing)
    
- Asking questions by itself is not damaging, however, when we ask trying to cover an emotional deficiency, the answer won’t solve the deficiency. Even if we get an answer (with proof) that would “solve” the deficiency, the deficiency stays. For example: asking “why is someone interested in me?”, “how can one healthily miss someone and how would it be unhealthy?”. In these cases, it would be ideal that one forego obtaining an answer until one has solved the deficiency. How would solving the deficiency look like? There could be a deeper answer, but one answer is: so that the physiological responses related to the deficiency are not there when asking the question or receiving the answer.
    
- why did women evolve to reject men but then accept them when they show enough commitment? this way they could prune out candidates that were not mentally capable of taking a defeat and would be blocked by the fear of rejection, which meant they were not the aptest for survival, because life will put many challenges, and those who thrive are those who keep trying. it also showed commitment, and that the candidate was able to put his seed and nurture it wherever he desired. in Christian terms, it showed those who truly loved her. in Buddhist terms, it showed those that detached enough that they could act in peace.
    
- Catcallers, while disrespectful, probably do not suffer of illnesses related to blockage of the throat chakra. Or suffer more than average
    
- It doesn’t matter whether ultimately you believe people will save themselves or not. It doesn’t matter if you look into the future and notice that we won’t or that we do. It’s a no-question. No second should be spent trying to answer it. What matters is that if YOU don’t take the hardest challenge you can to help save ourselves, YOU suffer and die.
    
- Lying is bad because of the following reason: similar to how skill produces a faster response in a certain way (because the brain gets strongly connected in a certain way), having a mental model of only truth makes you respond faster with the truth. When you start lying you change your brain to help you remember the lie faster next time. Eventually the lie is so ingrained in you that it is hard to distinguish it from the truth. And that’s when it is most possible that you mistake the lie for the truth in a situation where you otherwise would have responded correctly. This mistake causes suffering in either you or others. Ignorance is similar in that your brain is wired away from the truth, and your mistake causes suffering, but lying is worse because since you knew you could have avoided it, you reprimand yourself more, either consciously or unconsciously
    
- Emotions are important because they make the most fundamental/hardest question of a human at any moment “what should I do now?/what is good?” easier to answer. If you’re hungry you tend to that first. If you’re sad that should be your message that you should either change how you treat others, or treat yourself better, or find better people, or all.
    
- Based on the previous point, How to deal with professional instances that promote lying? Like applying for a job or making a proposal for a project. Well, help the recruiter/decision maker play out the consequences of continuing with a model that promotes lying. Identify the points where suffering would be created. Analyze whether steps are being taken to minimize that suffering, or which steps can be taken. Hopefully they will appreciate your capacity to analizar complex things carefully, and your intent to be honest with a strong reason why you should. If they don’t appreciate it, then you may avoid other problems by not working with them. Of course, make your best effort to constantly improve yourself as best as you can to reduce suffering caused by ignorance.
    
- The wisdom provided by the past is to be respected for it was attained with much more suffering than new wisdom
    
- While our culture’s descent into chaos can be seen as dangerous, it might be needed in order to ascend to all that we can become. We can integrate all that we have learned in this modern time and integrate it with our instinctual wisdom. It’s the Hero’s Journey at play. So let’s be calm and accepting of chaos, but work to improve it.
    
- Religious language is profoundly deep and reveals truths in many other domains
    
- Game idea: Mix of sliding puzzle and gameboard. Has arrows and walls. objective is to reach certain tile
    
- Truth reveals itself when seen through multiple dimensions of confirmation (for example, senses)
    
- The notion that an individual could be though of as sovereign was revolutionary when it arised. When systems line themselves with this idea, they are usually successful
    
- Christmas trees are filled with lights so that we can act out the proposition that in the darkest moments (winter), light reappears, and that we should celebrate it, and celebrate it as if it’s the birth of the redeemer
    
- Emotional skills (not living in the past, mitigating angst, etc) should also be practiced in the same manner one goes to the gym or practices other things.
    
- Real intellectual masterpieces express the fundamental question of existence more vividly than other lower quality works. This question could be formulated as: what is good and what is bad?
    
- People are itching for long term, deep discussion (see popularity of podcasts and GoT). It is good becAuse it allows for a proposition to be explored to its full extent, presenting evidence or counter arguments to really determine whether it is beneficial.
    
- The first truth of most religions is the acknowledgment of the existence of suffering (see Buddhism and the cross as the main symbol of Christianity)
    
- gay men tend to be wooed by an older man that introduces them to that world probably because they have not had a healthy relationship with a paternal figure that would guide them in their time of need. That could develop into other forms of young-old depravations. Solution is evident.
    
- a good way to test critical thinking in others is asking "where does sound come from when snapping fingers?" and listening for the reasoning used and how to test it. (answer: it comes from two places: from the thumb and the middle index rubbing and from the middle finger hitting the palm fast. but the loudest sound is the hit)
    
- we suspend disbelief while listening to certain stories because they fit archetipal patterns deeply coded into how we know we should be, therefore even though they are very metaphoric, we understand them. for example, in pinocchio, the father is trapped in the deepest part of the whale, and this is a nod to remember that in our darkest challenges we become our primordial father, our calling.
    
- governments only build where there is an economic benefit. therefore we can influence governments
    
- ar powered kite flying game (fly a physical kite and overlay an AR interface with game elements, perhaps using smart lenses. game could be about destroying an entity by physically moving the kite to hit it or by aiming and shooting virtual shots)
    
- Economists try and mostly fail to correctly predict human behavior. Is it that people who want to become economists are generally just looking for money, therefore they are probably low on emotional intelligence (because they are putting their happiness in money) which might indicate that they are in general low on general intelligence? In other words, if truly intelligent people were to become economists they would better predict human behavior?
    
- In a more emotionally healthy society, divorce would be as publicly known and supported as marriage. A lot of people would show up to the divorce to support the divorcees. The event would implicitly give the message to the community that the divorcees tried hard to know each other deeply, but failed, and people there would support them by implicitly saying that they recognize that a mistake was made but that it’s ok to make mistakes and they should just try harder next time.
    
- If personX claimed to personY that he could make personY understand an apparently very hard topic, that would probably motivate personY to understand it.
    
- the motivation behind an action affects the effect of that action on people. that is, you could do the same action with different motivations and that would affect you differently. For example, fasting for religious reasons, not eating because you don't have food, or not eating because something is more interesting at the moment.
    
- A hunch: the ways people can externalize ideas shape both the ideas and the people.
    
- Another hunch: the ways that people’s environments look and function shapes people as well
    
- What are other implications in our daily lives of the fact that the brain is “imperfect” and fools us (like with optical illusions)?
    
- if having a specific personality is defined as the extent to which your brain triggers a specific response to a specific type of situation, both in quantity and in speed, then changing this type of response can change a person's personality while not having the new response feel fake. a response can be defined as fake if it takes too much to come out (think being originally surprised at a received message but modulating the response to show coolness; the final response takes a moment to come out) or does not exhibit all the characteristics of an original response (think about how a fake smile does not engage the eyes). A benefit of this definition is that a fake reaction is not one that is new in a person, ie others don't think that a reaction you have to something is fake simply because it is new in you; therefore feel free to change.
    
- there seems to be a correlation between the number and type of variables in a problem and the conclusion of whether it is np complete or p. try prove that for a certain amount, it goes either way...?
    
- A way to improve the speed of reaction could be to first try to remember the intended new reaction to the situation as soon as possible after the situation happens. That will prime you to remember it sooner. Then try to remember it sooner and sooner every time the situation happens. Eventually it will be your first reaction. For improving the potency
    
- Of the reaction , try to "train" yourself to react potently to a similar situation. For example if trying to laugh harder or be more cheerful, you might try to dedicate a certain amount of time every week or every day to laugh harder at funny situations. Which will make your neural pathways for laughing stronger. Then you might try to connect the improved response to the situation more directly, for example by remembering your training whenever the situation comes up (ie being with friends), or every time you notice someone being how you want to become, or even when you notice someone being the contrary of what you want to become. This serves for any other personality trait like calmness, cheerfulness, social awareness, any of the big five personality traits, etc. You might also try to notice in which situations you hold back that response, and try to destroy the reason why you do so, by finding a logical reason why you ought to, and/or by doing some training.
    
- how attractive was jesus and how did that influence the spread of his message?
    
- what if people are moved to change by having many very deep emotional responses that create memories in them that slowly and incrementally change the way they are?
    
- if you are certain that there are people that would like you, because there are and because they should (because everyone's perspective of life is interesting with the right eyes) then there's no reason to worry that apparently few or none are currently appearing to show an interest.
    
- psychological improvement may be measured by comparing how you react to sometihng now and how you reacted to a similar thing before. if it takes you longer to feel bad or if you feel bad less strongly, or if you dont feel bad in reaction to it, you are improving
    
- Feedback is effective because you notice what you were assuming unconsciously
    
- Learning platform for entrepreneurship. Design support for developing the ability to see business opportunities, grow slowly wherever possible, dealing with formalizing, improve business math, improving the self and then developing social skills,
    
- how would I perceive someone who is trying to be bad but doesn't really want to? is this common? is it not commonly noticed? if it is common, why is it not commonly noticed?
    
- how powerful is black (or white) "magic"? is it just a psychological trap laid on victims? or can it be imposed on a victim far away, or on a victim nearby that does not understand the language? can the effect detonate in the past, present or future of the "curse" being placed? what are the benefits that can be drawn from this knowledge?
    
- The first math operation invented was comparison. Others built on it, but at the end we almost always go back to comparison (eg. do some complex economic models [complex math] to see which is more lucrative [comparison]). This way of ordering processes may be useful elsewhere
    
- Is there a way to make students not fear failing a class? Maybe by somehow removing the economic and social weight of failure? So that they are innately pushed by their curiosity to learn, and possibly do better than if they had those fears
    
- howd you describe sight to a person born blind
    
- Does ignoring someone create psychological stress? Why?
    
- los 3 mayores problemas de interne según su creador:
    
- 1) Las intenciones deliberadas y maliciosas, como el pirateo y los ataques informáticos apoyados por los Estados, la conducta delictiva y el acoso en Internet.
    
- 2) El diseño de un sistema que crea incentivos perversos en los que se sacrifica al usuario, como los modelos de ingresos basados en la publicidad que recompensan comercialmente el cibercebo y la difusión viral de la desinformación.
    
- 3) Las consecuencias negativas involuntarias del diseño benevolente, como el tono enfurecido y polarizado y la calidad de las conversaciones en Internet.
    
- Determining that good and bad are subjective and that nothing can be done to determine what is better than something else, is admitting yourself unintelligent/un capable of contributing in even a small degree to solving the problem. Don’t do it. You are capable of helping solve the problem of determining what is good and what is bad, even in a small degree.
    
- How does a [healthy psychological state of two people who hold intimate relationships but that are commonly disapproved by society] look like?
    
- A more direct way of defining intelligence could be to say that intelligence is the capacity to have more and stronger connections between concepts so that they more quickly serve a given purpose in a given situation
    
- Men and women are by default better suited for different things and naturally tasked with some tasks. So instead of stressing about one not doing something, play to your strengths and sinergize with the other.
    
- A cheap display (LEDs?) that lets users play digital soccer (pong?) while standing in commute (use simple hit and hurt boxes?) for entertainment and socializing
    
- thinking that you are allowed to do x thing because you have good intentions is not reason enough to decide to do x thing and then do nothing else (for example, a political party might think like this). things have to be analyzed carefully to mitigate unthought damages. on the other hand, thinking too much can stall progress. solution: test x thing in low-risk settings, and repeat: test, feedback, improve, scale, test, fb, improve, scale, etc..
    
- Streetpass but with personal information. You say what you want about yourself. Others can decide to contact or not. You could say false things but that should naturally be an indicator to people that you cannot be trusted. So people should carefully and safely explore whether they are true before connecting further. So the system would generally tend to suppress that behavior. Can be restricted to safe environments like universities or can be open on the street. helps connect people in an honest and more efficient way.
    
- A different way of testing knowledge wherein for a given topic, many options of problems to solve are presented. One of them has every concept that needs to be tested, so that if a learner solves it, he will get full marks for that topic. The other options have less concepts so learners get less marks if done correctly. In designing this, consider how to allow for some flexibilities
    
- How about having a naturally occurring “socialism”. You see, society is tending towards more entrepreneurship, because technology automated tasks, which forces you to have your own company, which would make people earn more equally.
    
- instead of saying how stupid a certain group is (for example flat-earthers), help them understand these complex concepts. if everyone complaining about other's stupidity made an effort to figure out how to make them understand (in any area) we'd be closer to what we want
    
- Some things about the current way education works should be changed. others probably are good enough. like grades for example. in principle, telling you how well you know something should make you try to get better at it. what needs to be removed is the stress and perceived consequences of having bad grades. that doesnt allow anyone to perform well. teachers should help reduce it. the point of education is learning, not getting a gpa.
    
- How to reduce the time that it takes to make a learning sciences research or how to reduce the scope of the research while still making it valuable
    
- For every election in every place, an easily shareable document/media (like an image that inside has a grid presenting the proposals of every candidate in every category) should carefully be made by politically informed and neutral people so that the cost of analyzing proposals is reduced for the public. People would probably share this massively in social media and similarly reaching channels. It should be made carefully and with lots of references to the original sources (because condensing information may distort it). And it should be edited frequently in the moments following its publication, as valid and objective feedback rolls in. Also, ideas presented should say a bit more about how the candidate thinks that he will make it real i.e. saying "X will be free" isn't intelligent enough. This document should say that this candidate is planning to pay for X with Y, for example.
    
- instead of saying "lets take x percent of money from people every year and somehow make it work" isnt it more intelligent to say "lets calculate how much we need to solve the things we care about, and them ask everyone a proportional part of their help to help solve them". of course, determining what "we should care about" is hard, but by slowing population growth a bit and taking time to calculate well and educate people well, we might get closer to the answer
    
- Try to make a debating game. Try to simplify an argument and reward those who notice the fault in an argument. Make it competitive (versus)
    
- How to make learning faster? We know how signals are transmitted in the brain. How the fact that some connections are stronger makes them be more probable to be fired when the neuron they start at is fired. For example, when a kid sees something, a few variables are firing: objectExists, objectPosition, objectColor. If hidden behind a blanket, probably ObjectExist would stop firing because he has no experience to tell him that blanket does no make object stop existing. In other words, the connection from objectExists to objectStillExists is not very strong. It is by hiding and showing again, a lot of times, that this connection gets stronger. If what I understand is correct, and the brain kinda randomly creates connections but it is experiences that solidify them, then to make this process faster one could either: find exactly where those connections are and put melatonin in them. Or figure what overall signal does the desired though create and promote that signal with electric ...
    
- ...Stimulation. Another way may be to look at adults brains of healthy people and notice that some areas are strongly connected in a specific way or base signals are always present, so maybe we should promote that way in youngsters. This sounds like creating the same person again, which could be dangerous, so efforts should be made to filter out just the most basic patterns that would constitute an improvement from the normal way to develop. Heavy math and statistics should help.
    
- The brain’s developmental process mimics evolution. Crazy ways to connect the brain happen almost randomly but the daily experiences strengthen or diminish these random connections. Now that I think of it, maybe that’s the reason sleep is so important. I notice I am most creative when I am about to fall asleep. Maybe sleep promotes the creation of these random connections. Since the judgements part of the brain is turned off, the neurons can grow freely. This is why sleep is so important. Imagine if your connections weren’t made in the first place. There would be nothing to improve.
    
- An idea is the connection of two concepts
    
- One must understand an idea only as deeply enough that when applying it, the deeper idea applies to as many areas that you should care about as possible, no more. For ex, knowing how the brain works only as deeply as to know that it is a group of neurons connected in a way that changes over time, is enough to apply it in many areas. But if you only stayed at the level of thinking that the brain is complex and helps you think, you can’t use that to create many solutions to many problems
    
- using dream time as creative work time since you can experience your ideas more vividly and change it as desired.
    
- Saying that a child in the zone of proximal development for a certain task cannot do some tasks without the help of others is over simplifying. A person could learn a language by speaking random sounds and noting the effects they had on people, until eventually they built a model for the language. But it would be slow and impractical, and the person may get frustrated, or, in moments of repeating something they know, bored.
    
- Speech is important in psychological development. It is a major psychological tool in the child’s development of thinking. 6 assumptions: adults tell children how the world works. Thoughts and language are initially separated because speech is first for communicating and socializing but is later used for thinking, as noticed when a child talks to itself. Complex mental processes begin as social activities. Children do more with better help. Hard tasks make children weed out better ways of thinking faster. Play helps simulate tasks.
    
- Promote faster connections of all possible connections of ideas to more quickly weed out the bad ones, having determined why they are so
    
- outsourced, gamified work: certain work that can't be automated is gamified and outsourced to people playing the game
    

**

- everyone should learn to think scientifically. it benefits everything one does. doesnt have to be as strict as "conducting research"
    
- teachers should spend much more of their working time analyzing the world to restructure what they teach so it is relevant. they should continually change
    
- to speak clearly, you have to have more ideas inside your head, so when you try to say something specific, you say that specifically, and not something else that can be interpreted another way. for ex. if you want to say pentagon, if you say "something like a square" it can be interpreted as a rectangle. the way to get these new ideas into the minds of people are different. maybe some need a big flashy and entertaining show, others not so much. the more we adapt the better. the more ideas we pass the better, but they should also be a bit filtered (more fundamental and important ides should be presented first and more frequently). and ideas must be interconnected from all other areas (SUPER IMPORTANT)
    
- humanity has been trying to teach the same lessons over and over again since time immemorial (that one should not judge anyone nor oneself, because one is a consequence of his conditions, etc) but what will it take for us to FINALLY get it right, and teach it to everyone, and have everyone practice it and adopt it?. first idea that comes to mind is to control the population for some time. until good seeds are planted in all current population so that it can multiply well. One may say: if it hasn’t been taught yet, will it ever. The answer is yes it can be. Before we didn’t have the technological advances we have today. The biggest technology was the book, so people made an effort to teach good things (the Bible) and look how successful that was. We can do even more.
    
- how do you call the "bar" that is being raised every time an innovation allows a person to do much more with less ability and how to promote the raising of this bar in every area?
    
- learning why people like something helps provide it more directly
    
- saying things in direct terms helps more easily provide it. in other words, saying directly (like in terms of what happens in the brain) is better than saying it in common speech (like saying "x person becomes more intelligent")
    
- people like fantasy animation films because it makes their brain more connected. the brain knows that becoming more connected is good for survival, so it responds positively. in fantasy, two ideas get connected through an uncommon reason. for example, fire and violence, seen through fantasy, can be connected though an idea of a "fire magic spell"
    
- we act ourselves into thinking differently more easily than we think ourselves into acting differently.
    
- The power of humor is so big that even if we have anything that is not positive feelings to a person, when that person is being humorous in our vicinity, our brain recognizes the humor as a reason to strengthen a connection between two previously unrelated concepts, and since the brain recognizes this as positive, because this stronger connection can come in handy in the future, it makes us react positively to it, without our control. in short, we can't control feeling good and showing it even if we don't like the humorous person. it makes us like them.
    
- trying to solve hard problems with easy solutions is a BIG PROBLEM. HARD PROBLEMS REQUIRE HARD SOLUTIONS. It’s not a bank or credit card company’s fault that a mass shooter use their credit cards, it’s his internal psychological problems. A woman shouldn’t be in jail for disciplining her burglar children
    
- there are games that make one happy to be alive and that helps people live, but too few games try to connect with a negative situation people may be living in (subtly enough that they dont lose interest because "someone is trying to fix them" but interestingly enough that it keeps their attention) and helps solve it by by: afterwards presenting the situation in a new, more positive light (changing people's perspectives), promotes mental techniques to improve wellbeing, promotes healthy relationships, etc
    
- If someone is cheating in something and for some reason they can’t be banned from the activity, others should simply stop playing or play very easily (in order to inadvertently bore the person faster). Of course, the deeper psychological problem of the person cheating should be treated (as this act of cheating kinda represents the equivalent of a person bullying others or going into random group chats to spam)
    
- when a person is doing something that takes most of their mental capacities, they will have little capacity left for masking the way they generally feel about someone else. This can help to quickly detect people's feelings to one another, but more deeply it can help to detect people who have things in their personality that should be improved. maybe this can be used in another area.
    
- Even though believers seem dumb to non believers, it's important that they stay believing because that way of interpreting this complex universe is mostly good for themselves and those around them. It makes them be good to others, etc. If believers (or non believers, this sentence makes sense either way) really are as intelligent as they think they are, they should notice this and promote it, so as to have many more good things in the world. Non Believers should only try to steer believers in a slightly different direction when believer's beliefs make them do unreasonable things, or things that it is hard to notice why they are unreasonable. Non believers should do this by trying to understand believers and saying things in believer's language.
    
- What if a video game allowed a person to feel angry at existence and live out that anger inside the game (by very precisely putting the person in a position that might invoke this anger and hopelessness) but then was guided by the game to notice this reasoning might be interpreted as flawed under a different set of rules, so they could get to tolerate living
    
- What if a game made people reflect of the sequences of events (ideas) that happen in order so that certain things, generally, repeat themselves through history, and then people reflected on what things repeat themselves so that bad historic events happen, and then people were shown how to notice those sequences and stop them
    
- Create a video Asking poor people what they would do to help solve huge problems of the world, to show that we need everyone, even the forgotten, to solve our problems
    
- Hacking the brain to think one is attractive and confident makes one more attractive and confident. In other words, one is actually playing the “attraction” game unoptimally if one does not project attractiveness. In other words, if a machine (or oneself) could hack one to believe oneself to be attractive, everyone would be more connected and happier.
    
- How does an idea look like
    
- Intelligence definition
    
- How ideas connect, how to connect them quicker. answer: neurons just kinda randomly grow. then if you use a pathway, it gets stronger.
    
- A story about a friend that teaches another friend many things. other things they discover together. they build an amazing friendship over years. every one of the elements that they learn about are, deep down, the same good lessons religions universally teach their believers. One of the friends is then faced with harder and harder challenges, but the lessons learned make him confident that he can tackle them. slowly they grow apart. one day, the other friend dissapears. in an emotional climax, the main character discovers the other friend was god or something softer like a superhero, a family member, a mentor, a spirit, or simply someone that cared for him/her. the point is that it leaves the audience as close as possible to being able to generalize this situation and understand that it applies to religion. That this concept has been provided to help you at the beginning, like training wheels, but if you don't let go of them, you will not go as far as you could. It is ok to stay in th
    
- is concept, but be humble and respect people who dont use training wheels, even if you dont understand them. BUT ABOVE ALL, UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO GO ON ALONE. THERE SHOULD BE NO FEAR> YOU ARE ABLE AND STRONG. AND YOU DONT NEED ANYONE TO TELL YOU THAT. YOU JUST NEED TO FOOL YOUR OWN BRAIN INTO BELIEVIN WHATEVER YOU WANT, AND< WITH DISCIPLINE AND TECHNIQUE< YOU WWILL ACHIEVE IT. BECAUSE THATS HOW THE BRAIN WORKS. YOU DONT NEED GOD. BUT THAT DOESNT MEAN THAT YOU SHOULD THINK HIGHLY OF YOURSELF. ON THE CONTRARY. HAVING HELP FROM ANYTHING OR ANYONE HELPS. BUT UNDERSTAND THAT CONCEPTUALLY YOU ARE FREE. DONT HAVE FEAR OF LOSING THE CONCEPT OF GOD. dont be sad. or change your belief of god so that you believe so hard on a concept so great, that it doesn't even need to be "true" to do what it says it will do
    
- people are not taught how to generalize
    
- why do people like metaphors like the one likening religion to training wheels? why do they say things like "oh this is so good"? because it allows them to notice a similarity between concepts, that is, it makes them more intelligent (more precisely, by finding a reason to more strongly connect two seemingly unrelated concepts, the neural pathway between them gets stronger. therefore next time they are presented with any of the two concepts, they have more connections to them. If they needed to solve something related to any of the two ideas, since they will be able to think ideas that others couldn't, and think them faster then others, they will seem more "intelligent"), and they instinctively respond positively to things that make them have more probability to survive (ie being more intelligent gives you more probability).
    
- The reason why reflection works is because people are forced to transform the information to another form of representing it, and when one person learns something in many ways, they learn it better
    
- pulling what you want when you want it is much more efficient than having stuff pushed to you at unwanted times, therefore businesses should provide supply when there is a pull and not be pushing all the time

- the more technical a language is, the more it demands one specific way of saying a thing and not even small changes are permited if a specific idea is to be transmitted. this expects the reader's language and cultural model to be the same as the writer
    
- Chatbot un which students are anonymous but to get access to the group of people with which they could connect to . they have to have a secret code that is shared in a group binding activity. The platform could provide a conversation topic every certain amount of time, or according to the conversation topic. The platform is anonymous so that people initially don’t judge each other based on their looks, but first find the good in each other and then decide to meet with the improvable parts of their personality, and has a code so that. Provide common sense tools but make it clear for users, maybe with a nice chart or animation, that there will be bad people and the solution is to deeply help solve their internal problems
    
- Music that makes you thankful to be alive is good because you focus on the good of your life, that is, you convince yourself that there are reasons to be happy/at peace. This convincing is important in any area because you become anything you think about yourself, but convincing yourself of something is hard (for example, you might need to convince yourself that you shouldn’t have negative thoughts, and you might need to dig deep and remember that you are very good to those around you)

- An online idea list where people could post ideas and others could come and use them. So uncreative but practical people can create those ideas, and creative but unpractical people can post them. Ideas would be tagged for easy retrieval
    
- Imagine the set of every possible idea connected in every possible way to every other idea. The creative process can be defined as a way to select one or many of these connections based on an objective previously decided on. Namely, some of these connections help achieve the objective to a certain degree.
    
- Apply Machine Learning to deciding which words to use to better communicate a specific idea and not other ideas
    
- Aply ML to decide how to best compress a music file. That is, if a file is compressed by expecting to hear something next, and only saving the difference of what is actually heard next (like compressed lossless formats do) decide with ML how to better select the chunks though which these “expected sound pieces” are found. That is, if the first minute sounds more similar than the second minute, compress each minute differently and say so in the header so it is decompressed correctly
    
- Apply ML to decide the times of a traffic light

- Having negative thoughts is a tool to push yourself to help improve yourself. Dismissing them by “thinking good thoughts” or “being grateful” may dis acknowledge their important function. Those techniques should be used as a step towards peace of mind, that is, one should think “yes, I should improve this because of that, but I shouldn’t worry so much about this because of those”
    
- I think it’s important that instead of analyzing answers to something individually, we try to see what is the undergoing pattern and talk more in these direct terms, because we will end up giving answers that are more effective and we will waste less effort thinking about those answers. For example, when answering “why do we need a leader “ or “what are your strengths?” say something that directly goes towards why that person is a good fit for passing on its genes (which is the end goal of every human endeavor). Maybe not so crudely. But the closer you get, the more effective it will be. For example say: I have the cognitive skills to organize people in groups, instead of saying “I’ve always been a natural leader. With over ten years of experience in finance and sales, I’ve exceeded my KPIs every quarter and have been promoted twice in the past five years. I look back at those successes and know that I wouldn’t have reached them if I hadn’t built and led teams composed of highly skil
    
- led and diverse individuals”. You might argue that there is a reason why things are the way they are, I’m just arguing that maybe this is more effective.
    
- Answering a weakness question boils down to showing whether or not you pass basic minimum skills needed and whether you are doing an effort in the other skills. For ex if a job requires writing and you can’t, bye. And if you have the basics and you say you have too much or too little X, if you don’t convincingly show that you are working towards fixing t, bye. In other words, it’s not so much of a question of whether people are able to develop that non essential but important skill that you mention, but whether you’re working on it (more people than expected can work on them)
    
- Leadership is needed because they have capacities others don’t. For example, in non intelligent animals they have strength. In intelligent animals they have the cognitive capacity to explain something in a logical way that makes sense in regards to a desired goal. When they explain this to others, it makes more sense to these other people than another explanation they may have heard, which makes them follow his idea.
    
- Technology tool to help evaluate people in a mastery based learning environment. One way to implement it could be to ease the way to evaluate a topic in a homework, and keep track of their score in that topic, and then evaluate the same topic in an exam, and if a person does well in that topic their final score is better, and then a cumulative exam later on could provide another opportunity. Keep track of this for all topics. Instead of keeping track of a mushing together of topics. Add some tool to more easily scan test results like a little box on the corner of a problem with some QR coding or etc
    
- Idea to solve some mental issue: try sparingly thinking consciously about the issue and immediately calming yourself, so that you link that issue to calmness, therefore solving it.
    
- Can we force people to be socially integrated?
    
- She said one of the reasons she broke up with me was that I was kind of a dick sometimes. For some of my life I’ve spent a bit of my conscious effort convincing myself that I am not worthless. Both things seem incompatible. A "dick" will probably apparently feel too highly of itself. But mass shooters may act as such because their identity as masculine may be called into question, therefore they double down on their masculinity. In a similar way, maybe I acted imperceptibly as a dick, and my brain didn’t register it in the same way their brain doesn’t register in, in a effort of my brain to produce the desired outcome without having me consciously intervening to evade it from happening, but it being caught up by others. (Other factors also helped the break up)
    
- Democratize art and expression
    
- Help people connect more in commute
    
- Streamline the creative process by creating app that randomly connects 2 or more ideas. allow it to save to a file. might make people less creative but humanity would have easier access to a super fast amount of creative content that would push us forward that much faster. for example: a fighter where you change gravity to up or down with a push of a button.
    
- Create apps that allow self expresión in novel ways. Like , using the app would be the artistic expression

- If on is more intelligent, t takes more time to take any decision? Because one is able to think of more possibilities, and then has to decide which is the best.
    
- Dreams help you find what you’re mad about
    
- Society has to work on erasing the inhibitions that block the presentation of any types of ideas. Imagine a soc in which every idea was shared. Structures should be built to channel them to the appropriate places, because they may be too many.
    
- Capacity to judge more than one possibility should help you be better. But that mental capacity has to be there first. For example for people who don’t accept drag churches
    
- One doesn’t need to be scared of not having someone to trust. The best chance one has is to treat everyone with love and hopefully that will (in case the other person is in an improvable state) improve their state (e.g. fix them if they’re bad), but one has to be careful and wise to avoid danger, but one shouldn’t fear death.
    
- When one thinks of natural life in our universe, one can conclude that one can’t just do whatever one can think of, that there are some things that are more recommendable to be done in order to achieve certain objectives (for example eating to survive, being kind to live more comfortably). One might compare it to coming to life not with a clean slate, but with a slate with a few margins set up, and a few drawings already in place. Living a life that approaches the Tao can be though of as trying to live as close as possible to that hypothetical clean slate.

- How to interpret fear: as the reminder to do the thing, and not worry. See it like two bars in which you minimize one and maximize the other. Therefore solving the problem of how to balance the importance of fear with the importance of not caring. This is measurable and concrete: technically, every time you worry, it can be determined, and to which grade. At least, imagine it is. Ex: fear of rejection. Response: don't worry and remember to improve self if you want to. Ex: fear of failure. Response: don't worry, and remember to study if you want to.

- Wheres the mid point between acceptance of what you cant do and creating your own realities? maybe it is on whether what I want depends on the other or on myself: if it depends on others, theres an infinite chance I will o will not achieve it because theres an infinite set of possible other peoples response. but if it depends on myself, I can control everything. technically. its not easy. and so theres infinite potential
    
- The fact that there are realities that it is just too hard to achieve by your own training may be explained by the fact that you are lacking training (lack the training of accepting) or the whole universe (being interpreted as one)is lacking and we are not being able to see that we are all one and should not be scared of death, divided, and we may work together to achieve anything
    
- If you cannot create any reality you can think if, you still have work to do
    
- Liberating chakras practice for enterprises
    
- If you want to sway people to do anything, reward them for doing it and reward them in a way that reinforces the habit you are building
    
- Suggest ppl to work on the most important problems, and when those fill their demand, work on the next more important, and suggest how marginal changes in what they do might help the biggest problems and reward them positively by doing that
    
- Is there a mental or physical ability that could be taught to protohumans to avoid them developing the bug that caused the psicological imbalancs felt today?
    
- if you consider the ultimate goal of existance to develop the skills to create your own reality, by developing those mental skills to their full potential, then the idea that reality is a hologram makes more sense, since any reality is a created reality proyected by someone else. it still feels one is not capable of comprehending reality deeply, and you have to live with it.

- you may think that you would want to permanently increase the power with which your brain does connections. but not neccesarily. you don't want the undesired to be improved. that's why its important to use the neuropriming headbands only in the desired moments and being focused
    
- imagination or memory of the correct action is the ideal action you want to repeat before doing it. thats the ideal youre pursuing. that tells you if what you are doing is correct. thats why its neccesary to receive feedback
    
- strenght is increased if neurons fire efficiently to the correct muscles and in the correct order. that creates: more strength, less energy waasted, more precisely doingwhat you want to
    
- the shadow has powerful and creative potential
    
- separate each of these points in categories: ideas, questions, action ideas
    
- It is always in the best interest of yourself and others to do the actions that have the least probability of damaging others or yourself, even if you are not that clear of how the damages would affect you or others. Example: in any given moment anyone has the possibility of doing something that would do damage to others with a 100% probability, like killing them, or not, which would have a 0% probability of doing damage. However, usually determining these probabilities is hard, but the effort must be made to determine them and to do the least damaging. For example: It's hard to determine whether going into bitcoin in its current state is damaging, but since right now it is pretty much like gambling, and there is a probability that you damage others, it is actually damaging, because there is a probability that you take the money from others, and so both those who win or lose should be punished.

- since theres a chance i may have narcissistic tendencies and that in reality i crave attention, even though i logically understand that it is senseless, and so therefore since i havent classically received the usual attention and didnt have the claassical strong body or strong personality , i coped with it by being compliant and good, andthen tried growing physically, is there a psycological mechanism stronger than my desire to grow that keeps me from workout/sleep/eat/drink water in the key moments? is it this same fear? this desire to grow in other ways that will get me what my subconscious desires?

Ppl can and should post their dreams anonymously and the steps how to achieve them. Hopefully people would notice that saving the world is the biggest dream possible and the best methods would be distilled, while making it game like to try to guess which ones are bigger compared to what others have said

- Categorize these ideas in an inverse piramid
    
- If one wins a prize for their ideas, its not then that one should be congratulated, because their ideas or skills or attitudes arent suddenly useful when they are recognized. One should have a gaze wide enough to recognize ideas/skills/attitudes that are useful and nurture them from their roots
    
- In the same manner that my mom has certain intelligences developed and that has allowed her to achieve cerrain objectives, equally anyone developing other intelligences may be able to achieve even more efficient objectives. We must go deeper
    
- You could see society as giving a continuum of benefits and asking a continuum of responsabilities. People that not want to take the responsabilities should either not receive any of the benefits, or they can propose their deserved amount of benefits based on the other responsabilities they take. Or society could suggest to them the benefits appropiate to them

- intelligence is an indicator of high possibility of survival. intelligence is based on capacity to connect ideas by certain link. laughter is provoked by a surprising connection on an idea you hadn't connected yourself. therefore, maybe evolution developed laughter to provoke a positive reaction in your body after you had been presented with a new link, that is, an indication of intelligence, so you associate positive things with that person, because that person has intelligence, making you want to procreate with that person, increasing the chance that your descendants survive.

- Dividing efforts to the smallest possible is the way to go, and do them one after another, and the process of doing the dividing is important so it should be trained. Applies to meditation and determining career path and who knows what else

- Kid friendly web platform for people to suggest hierarchization of problems with different diagrams to express them, and the proposed solutions to each, and uploading your own, and voting, and different parts for different society groups
    
- Indicator of intelligence could be the need to express feelings more or less explicitly
    
- when comparing degrees or actions, evaluate them in regards to how much each directly relates to people and that way you will find the higher impact route
    
- my reason for pursuing a degree in something like public policy / data analysis is because even though science is interesting and people like me would do the science-y jobs for pure love of science, a position like analist would be beyond boss-employee, and would allow me to positively influence every boss-employee scheme
    
- how does a body that evolved adapted to technology would look like? for humans? for other species?
    
- its understandable that music may be banned in some places by the reasons given, but still banning is not the solution, for music is merely an expression of what is inside, and that may resurface somehow else. therefore, changing the self-harming desires inside is the solution (like those that push for adultery, which is usually psicologically harming)
    
- If i write a book, i may put it up for free and just ask for donations if it was useful, also suggesting an amount based on market and usefulness.

- "Redirecting energy/actions" is an easy way to achieve things. It consists of using the same energy you would have used, but in a better way, like when deleting email you wont use instead of leaving it there
    
- How will the brain change if it does not need to go pee because of a system that would automatically take it out
    
- Rather than intelignence, maybe child bearing per family can be regulated by "capacity of parents to have control over their circumstances", or their worldviews or attitudes, and instead of regulated,,maybe it can just be suggested
    
- maybe you need sleep in the same manner that you need to balance your "spiritual" side, as a way on unconsciously tapping into the pottential of the mind, without which you wouldnt function properly, because life is balance. thats why its recomended to meditate just before and after sleep. so that you more consciously can tap into that.
    
- time is a consequence of cycles, its a result of physical things. implications: no reason to run late. body cant escape passage of time because the body is physical
    
- instead of seeing mysticism and science as separate entities it might help to see them as gradients of a continuum, in which maybe mysticism has put forth a broader view of the system, and science a narrower one, and in doing so science has endeavored to bring more slowly the "perfect progress", one in which we get the most out of everything. but life, it appears, is all about balance, and one must balance both views.
    
- right now my interest is in equally increasing human intelligence in all of its facets, in balance. first in me and then in others.
    
- there are 4 dimensions of intelligence: intellect, personality, memory and pure intelligence. if you don't believe in pure intelligence, you can just focus on creating that concept yourself and harnessing
    
- dont promote good or bad experience because fundamentally there is no good or bad, but promote those less limiting experiences, to allow for freedom
    
- creativity breeds free connection into what makes us be certain way, and to breed creativity one could be prompted to be creative by writing or talking freely, alone or with a friend. or prompted by software... or analized by software
    
- nature and nurture both contribute to your development and path to balance but what you decide (of course, you can't decide by yourself, something else plants in you the inspiration that you can do anything, and i think actions speak louder than words. sometimes doing AND saying that others can do it [whatever] could MOST help transmit the message, although that may be tricky to implement because some people might not like to be told or feel it's dishonest, but trying to be open and sincere should help. not everyone can be pleased) influences the most

- advocate for travel companies to suggest bonding experiences for their riders, with the benefits: bonding for passengers, great ride, more passengers. the suggestion could come from audio or from printed text. they should be answered in each division people are seated by. they should cover every aspect of people like: where are you from and what do you like most from there? whats the craziest thing you've done for love? what do you think of

- how to choose nonharmful acts: benefits extremely outweigh damages, benefits shared somewhat equitatively, consent, harms are unintended
    
- least possible to be automated: creativity, social skills and perception/manipulation
    
- Intelligence is a better predictor of survival than beauty. this shouldn't make you feel detached from people because they are less intelligent. same as with beauty
    
- investigate if overall emotional inteligence or general inteligence has gone up or down in society or in important peoples circles
    
- it definitely seems like to solve the big problem of thriving well as life, only solving emotional intelligence might not be the solution, because you might have a hypothetical perfect mental state but deploy the wrong technology in the wrong manner. BUT it definitely seems to help to have a better state because it makes you more effective at investigating effects of something or learning or surviving or being happy.
    
- imagine a world in which no matter if we develop the most dangerous technology or idea, it doesn't get used badly (term relative to the achievement of personal goals that respects two principles: the golden rule and the no irrevesibility rule) because we have developed the X hability as a society (X = hability im trying to find)
    
- if it's proven that humanity does more damage than good, maybe we can pass into another type of existance in which we do less damage instead of just destroying humanity altogether, like in a digital consciousness or other forms not imagined yet. or humanity could learn to control itself
    
- how could you prove that our lives are worse than they are good?
    
- an intelligence should be understood as the capacity to perform a certain objective. you might achieve it but more inefficiently if you are less intelligent in that intelligence
    
- maybe its general intelligence that should be upped instead of only emotional
    
- we should not only give society to the next generation but give it in a state that permits them to choose their destiny and with no chance for unhappy lives to come into existence
    
- people should make active efforts to determine whether certain actions are ones that they would impose on every person, in the same manner, they would have them imposed on them and should not accept irreversible actions or ones that not permit others to decide or take the liberty of desition to others
    
- philosophy shouldnt be taught as history but as practice and evaluation
    
- is stubborn scientific ignorance not rooted in emotional problems?
    
- is it absurd to worry about the sufferings of people in the past instead of worrying about the present? if it is, is it absurd to worry about the present instead of worrying about the long term?
    
- whenever you think about something large scale, anchor to that the though that you might die anytime so find ways to pass on that benefit that you plan to create, in a smaller and quicker fashion
    
- you shouldnt worry about most things, but should care about important things. you should then define what important things are. (mark manson article: the subtle art of not giving a fuck) my addition: maybe you should test and evaluate each thing to determine which really give you happiness.
    
- nobody who has received the benefits of modern society and enjoyed them has the right to decide to end these benefits for others in the future, since others in the past have given the benefits to them. if one has received them and not enjoyed them, that person should be put out of society by themselves, and if not, by society. and therefore should not have a part in deciding the fate of society. if one thinks society shouldnt be, one should try to fix it instead.
    
- this is perhaps the most important scene of human history: the one when we just discovered the power to end it all, but didn't. because we really developed, and used, all the time, the one key to defeat any possible hardship: not giving a fuck (and giving fucks to important things)

- Is there a connection between inteligence in certain areas and emotionl intelligence? Great minds seem to have had great control of their emotions which allowed them to develop amazing advances
    
- Maybe psychodelics are banned precisely because they show the parts that we do not want to face, but SHOULD FACE to have a better life. WHY? Because those minute, microscopic emotional traumas, restrictions, embarrassments, reppresions, regrets, fear, resentment, affect us in big ways in our outter actions, even if we dont notice the connection
    
- Psychodelic drugs amplify your mental states, therefore i think you could be able to prepare beforehand to have a good experience. You have to be aware of the things that bother you, scare you, etc, and work out how not to let them control you. Dreams are a great tool. In them you can explore and notice what makes you angry, sad or scared, and you have to for example learn that those people dont have the blame of your anger, you cant be sad if you have no objective and so deeply you could be having no objective and not be worried about anything but on the surface you could have one because you enjoy it, and that you shouldnt be scared because nothing,is real not even reality and if you die, its ok, thats how the universe is, accept it and flow, and you should have practiced all of these techniques in any possible scenario so that when you come to a psychodelic experience, you react in the beneficial form because of your training

- Compulsory meditation for politicians and people in power with the best trainers available. benefits?
    
- Teach emotional intelligence at school
    
- the best "good old days" is right now
    
- one key point to focus on in the problem of expanding the use of transformative technologies is the fact that there are so many people with problems and so many technologies to help in this but people are not aware or distracted from their problems, so they dont even start their journey. And so maybe by determining, developing, improving and promoting the methods that most effectively make people notice their problems and motivate them to solve them, one can jump start others own journey and fewer energy is spent in the process because people by themselves would provide their own energy to help in their salvation and one wouldnt have to help make every single aspect more accesible
    
- the key conditions that helped me find this path: an upbringing of generally "doing good", capacity for orderly, critical analysis, intelligent focus/enjoying all the time learning about important things, not being extremely busy, a comfortable upbringing, internet, relatively little social demand for my person, no or low demanding romantic relationship
    
- a practical way of seeing "living in the moment" would be doing fewer things at a time every moment
    
- its cool how for a single person the salary over which you get no more happy is 40k, but for a household it's 75k, instead of 80k or more, considering children - synergy at work
    
- a measure of happiness should be absolute , that is, measured equally in every person, even if it is affected by local or subjective effects
    
- a poll to measure levels of happiness in which you select 5 to 10 out of like 30 or 40 options which best describe your state. the thing is, deeply you dont really know that they are measuring happiness. you take the test every day or every certain amount of time. it could be taken online. the options are shuffled everytime.
    
- How can we evolve our intelligence more? Maybe we might develop physical hurt when we hurt others, explained because survival of others proves to help my own survival. what else?
    
- why does doing low mentally tasking tasks help the brain think more creatively? Because thats when the neurons can expand their firing patterns to other less used paths. How does focusing concretely work? more frequent firing patterns in less open paths. how do you decide to focus? same as how you decide anything. theres no free will. something pushes you to decide so.
    
- what if you didnt get likes or public comments? Or what if others couldnt see you likes or public comments? Or what if only others could see them? you would start sharing purely for the innate joy of sharing and the real benefits of connection
    
- Its important to have the practice of insight post action/emotion, but The most critical intervention may be before the emotion is felt or the action (corruption, violence, worry) is taken. That is the key moment to think, do they deserve this? Are they imperfect too? Remember that the concept of a person doesnt really exist, so the fears i have cant be labeled to my person.
    
- Show all of these lessons in art like fictional stories, songs, games, etc
    
- practical, permanent application of insight is vital for balanced life. maybe reminding to reflect on emotions had while passing social media content would help. how? with social media content, perhaps

- Children are a great way to continue the narrative of your life or project, because by living with you they may better understand why your vision is important
    
- People, if living in a society, should abide by its rules because they will receive the benefits of that society. If they dont, or dont want to take the responsabilities, or want to have the benefits without doing the responsabilities, they should be denied any benefit of that society, including access
    
- Why would people not wanna receive the benefits of a society?
    
- computer vision for finding lost people from above
    
- MORE KNOWLEDGE = LESS SUFFERING
    
- you can play flute in dreams and the sound corresponds (?) (less fingers = sharper sounds)
    
- determine wether for me, I prefer work that is interesting over good quality of workplace and being paid what the work is worth. maybe by reading 80000hours
    
- people help each other... to help themselves and survive as genes would like... or is this a proof of something outside genes implanted somehow into people? is this question too loosely defined?
    
- weak agnosticism: i cannot prove the existance or unexistance of a god, but maybe in the future there will be evidence
    
- there is a reason to help others: in this complex world, helping others helps yourself, in ways you may not be conscious of
    
- the loosely defined boundaries problem: the problem that when things are loosely defined, we waste time arguing them. "waste" because we may not reach a clear verdict BECAUSE they are loosely defined. debating by itself is not a complete waste: it serves as entertainment, to see good or bad qualities in other, and to exercise mental functions useful in other things
    
- consciousness is a mistery
    
- improve hands actions with electronics by reading hands variables with more than one sensor for each variable, so that variables can be reconfirmed
    
- Develop technology that sends signals to the brain in a way so convincing that you cant tell the difference between reality and the dream. Helps people make their own reality more easily. Send all corrupt politicians and bad people in. Voila. No one else has to suffer from them.
    
- People always laugh when talking about sex, or when its suddenly introduced. Is it because we are hardwired like that? To make a positive association with it, to promote it subconsciously, to pass on genes?
    
- Try to follow genuineness or authenticity, not kindness (moderately/dont make it the end goal) or respect, not loudness nor silence, but genuinness
    
- Art can be used as a weapon to show anger or disagreement about an event happening on our time and place. could it also be used as such to express genuine disgust at events not in our universe or reality?
    
- As a boost to genuinness, whenever a message cant get through, connect to the power of the message and pass it appropiately
    
- Make The Call of the heros journey more available more frequently to everyone so they ccan reap the reward of the journey for themselves
    
- People live in a Trance and dont experience the heros journey and its a shame
    
- You dont waste time going inside yourself to your heros journey, even if you wish your journey to have a large impact. Remember that the journey has a Return, where you share that knowledge gained
    
- People kill others unadvertedly, when they dont accept them. And, currently, dont pay for that crime
    
- Work hard against all odds and even without the support of of those youd expect
    
- Youre out for yourself, even if you have parents, do things for yourself, do the effort yourself, they may be wrong
    
- You have a vocabulary of words you use and another wider one of words you understand but not necessarily use
    
- The ultimate method for transmission of information would be brain to brain. You wouldnt need to know a common language. Or maybe yes? Are ideas a certain wave pattern, not matter the language you express them in? What if people havent experienced that idea? Like color. Would they know what youre transmitting to them? How does the brain perceive a certain idea? It seems the same idea can be interpreted differently by different parts of the brain. For example the idea of knee has, related to it, the idea of the sound of the word knee, the idea of how to move vocal cords to make that sound, the idea of how to move your hand to reach it, of its image, color, position, etc. Is it the signal different from person to person?
    
- Brains are molded by language
    
- Everything under the sun is invented... But maybe not the combination of two or more
    
- Big city but not knowing a lot of people
    
- Life tends to light, to randomness, to innovation, even if it appears otherwise, thats its going to darkness, stability, no energy
    
- people connect with 1 deep conv
    
- its not enough to live near people, they have to love, that is: they have to connect/understand each others likes, dreams, difficulties, and have support of each other in complementary ways like in pphysical, economic, or emotional (amplifying good things and acknowledging but diminishing bad things) support (remember, its a two way street, you cant say " i didnt receive love as a child" you also have to ask yourself if you gave it back. of course, you need a minimum received to be able to copy it, but i guess most people, hopefully, receive the minimum)
    
- You may be living "good" but still, work on yourself
    
- Most things have been invented but the effort must be made to make them available
    
- Go back to the ununderstood perfectness of childhood
    
- Unknown powers of awareness
    
- Use dreams to achieve goals. Train while dreaming
    
- Brain is the ultimate game/anything console
    
- Time travel/ would you live knowing whats to come, good or bad
    
- Creating new cultures/worlds in a deep way
    
- The heros journey
    
- Power of visualization/you make your reality
    
- The pursuit of Flow state
    
- Politicians should take an exam before going up
    
- Use a diferent democracy
    
- The best system rewards hard workers based on their efforts and still keeps everyone over a minimun, giving them the chance to reach the others. No cheating
    
- Art is almost anything done by man. being, talking, writing, exercising, thinking, working, etc. in a unique way could be interpreted as art
    
- because art could be interpreted as a way to express something
    
- Art helps convince people
    
- Art helps people communicate
    
- All human acts are influenced by dna
    
- we as living beings are a type of AI
    
- Dreams
    
- All the time knowing something or someone, now it's revealed it didn't exist
    
- Something "forgotten by time"
    
- Make compassion a desirable idea/why are people greedy
    
- Make being informed a desired thing
    
- laughter is a way to socialize with more people. it sends a " evrythiings ok" msg
    
- a perfect way of transporting people, sharing rides with anyone, perhaps. make sure they are safe people, for example
    
- sharing current to-do lists may be a novel way to know others deeply
    
- humans are called to be well-rounded, not especialized
    
- Lets work to give purpose to us and others
    
- what you become at the end depends a lot in the ambient. people more or less start off on the same course. very small pushes at the beginning, in certain directions, have a big impact at the end. so focusing on that part is more efficient than on their adult age
    
- To age less, eat less and stay cold more
    
- Politicians using computer software to unadvertedly look more like the average voter in propaganda to make the average voters more likely to vote for them
    
- you can have opinions, but true knowledge is unobtainable. then why even have opinions if theyre not certain? have less opinions. use more facts
    
- free will exists or not?

- Social media summary in a single spreadsheet. One column is the user, another the context, another whether there are attachments. Helps use social media less

- Present your goals to others in a central place in your social media of choice, so they can support you and you can support them. Create a post announcing and explaining it

- Software to suggest when to charge cars based on upcoming weather forecasts

- Most “low tech” or “old tech” has some advantages to “modern tech” that can be further improved by using a little bit of new tech, so that in some dimension they are better than either of those two initial options

- problem: many individuals traveling alone in a vehicle pollute the world. Going with strangers in their car would benefit from a well developed software platform and/or company that vet the people. Developing that tool would take effort, and the companies which already have that have not opened their tool widely enough. Solution: a chatbot to which you link your contacts. Each person sends to the chatbot their planned travel, and the bot matches them with a friend that is going in a similar direction. To avoid handling sensitive information, users could write sources and destinations in ways only they and their friends understand. But knowing the actual source and end would allow the software to automatically link those going in similar directions. Another option to reduce risk vectors is to only hold the plan of travel for a limited amount of time. A user could input their plan and immediately get a list of friends going in a similar direction, or friends traveling the same day, or in a close enough range of hours, or they could get all of their friends plans and figure out themselves the one who is going in their direction. A great benefit would be if the chatbot later told them that it has found a friend matching going in their direction, when the friend inputs their plans. Or the user could come later to see if any new friend has input plans

- problem: people have needs, and they can be supplied by each other
